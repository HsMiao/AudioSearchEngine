If you wanna cancel me, you're gonna have to be a biracial lesbian who is also trans and in a wheelchair. And even then, I'm gonna be like, yeah, but how much money do your parents make? And she's gonna say, I'm adopted. And I get to go, okay, you win this round, little miss, how you? Now, hold on, time out. I want y'all to know something.

And we don't know why he was mad. He got mad at Bud Light. Bud Light gave one trans TikToker her own specialized can of Bud Light, and everyone lost their minds. And because we're serving drinks here, let me just say this. Bud Light is the best beer I've ever had. Bud Light cannot make you trans. Bud Light cannot make you trans. The only thing Bud Light can make you That's all that drink has ever done is bring boys together. Now, you know what I mean? Me personally, I don't drink Bud Light.

This sounds like the past, yay, to be honest with you. My family's from Lebanon. You know, I'm from Canada. Like, I'm raised in Canada. But my mom raised over in Lebanon. So my mom grew up with, like, Israeli tanks. She was a soldier. She had Israeli tanks rolling through her village. Like, they used to come into the house and do check stops all the time. It's a crazy way to grow up. One day, the Israeli military fired a missile at my grandma's house. And it broke through the wall and just landed inside and just spun out. And they just all had to, like, just didn't explode. The missile just did not go off. And they all just had to, like, back away from the missile and just, like, pray that nothing happened. And then the Israeli military just came and, like, scooped it up. They're like, . And then they just took it and left. But if that missile went off, I would have never existed. Like, my whole family would have been vapor. I wouldn't be here talking to you guys right now.

I like a lot of my life. I love this. I love you guys. I wouldn't have chosen this particular universe to exist in. Do you think I would have picked the place with fucking raisins and Kid Rock? No. I would have gotten somewhere else. But ultimately, I'm like, I don't know, man. I guess if my mom had aborted me, I'd be exactly like you.

One of them didn't even die. I'm going to tell you both stories. The first one, she did die. She was dating a white dude. White dudes don't miss. Y'all are efficient. Shot her right in the head. Boom. Head shot. Right? But here's where he messed up. He tried to make it look like a suicide. He put the gun in her hand, wrote a bullshit note, did all this stuff, made it look like a suicide. Detective walks in. Here go the first clue that broke the case wide open. Detective comes in. He goes, uh-huh. Black lady? Suicide? Mm-mm. Black women don't do that. Did you know that less than 1% of all suicides in America are black women? Black women got to deal with racism and sexism and still be like, nah, I'm going to try again tomorrow, motherfucker. They don't give up. So if you kill one, don't make it look like suicide. Nobody believe you. The other one, it was a brother. He was with his wife for 30 years. He got sick of her, found a young woman. He said, I'm a boss. I'm going to buy some arsenic, kill my wife, run off with the younger woman, right? So the brother buys some arsenic. He started pouring it in his wife's coffee. Wife wouldn't drink the coffee. She's like, when you start making coffee, motherfucker? She wouldn't drink it, right? So you know, if a brother buys some arsenic, we going to use it. You know what I'm saying? So the brother, he snuck into her job on the weekend. He stole her work badge, broke into her job on the weekend, poured the arsenic in the water cooler. He said, damn it, I'll kill everybody. I'll kill everybody in this office. Just to kill my wife. But if you know anything about arsenic, you can't pour too much. Because you get a bitter taste. You know what I'm saying? It'll kill somebody, but they'll know something's going on.

It's a young, male, orphaned protagonist who, for his own safety, has been sent to live with his aunt and uncle until a mysterious bearded stranger, who's actually the one to deliver him, to his aunt and uncle when he was a baby, comes into his life and starts to teach him about this ancient kind of magic. Granted, he's gonna learn a lot more about this magic from an older, wiser wizard who's high most of the time. Regardless, his uncle is totally against this magic stuff. He won't even tell him what really happened to his parents. But against his uncle's wishes, he leaves home for the very first time, makes some new friends, meets a pretty, impetuous young girl. And though there will be an odd sexual tension between the two of them throughout, he will only love her like a little girl. He will only love her like a little girl. He will only love her like a little girl. He will only love her like a sister while she struggles with the feelings that she has for his best friend, the scruffy comic relief. And then he learns of the existence of this supervillain who killed his parents with his sorcerer's ways before he started calling himself Lord Something or the Other. But quite fortunately, it turns out that our hero is naturally good at flying and locating incredibly small targets. And he's not just a little boy. He's a little boy. He's a little boy.
